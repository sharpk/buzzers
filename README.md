This project is a set of quiz show style buzzers.  The brains of the operation is an arduino, which is attached to 4 button boxes equipped with a large button and a series of colored LEDs.  The main control box houses the arduino and 4 indicator LEDs that display the order in which the buzzers are pressed.
